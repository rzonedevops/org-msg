# Microsoft Graph connector agent sample

[![dotnet build](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-connector-agent-sample/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-connector-agent-sample/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml) ![License.](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

Microsoft Graph connectors let you add your own data to the semantic search index and have it power various Microsoft 365 experiences. This .NET application shows you how to use the [Microsoft Graph connector agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/graph-connector-agent) and the [Microsoft Graph connectors SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/custom-connector-sdk-overview) to create a custom connector that indexes items from a sample appliance parts inventory. This connector sample powers experiences such as Microsoft Search, Copilot in Teams, the Microsoft 365 App, and more.

## Prerequisites

- The [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your Windows development machine (Windows 10 or later, or Windows Server 2016 or later).
- You should have a Microsoft work or school account with the Global administrator role. If you don't have a Microsoft account, you can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Microsoft 365 subscription.
- The [Microsoft Graph connector agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/graph-connector-agent) installed on your development machine.

## Configure the sample

1. Generate a new GUID to use as the connector ID for your connector. You can use PowerShell to generate a GUID with the following command.

    ```powershell
    [guid]::NewGuid()
    ```

1. Open **appsettings.json** and add the following, replacing `YOUR_CONNECTOR_ID_HERE` with the GUID you generated.

    ```json
    "Connector": {
      "ConnectorUniqueId": "YOUR_CONNECTOR_ID_HERE"
    }
    ```
