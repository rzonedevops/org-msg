Namespace: microsoft.graph

Remove an owner from a [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) object. As a recommended best practice, service principals should have at least two owners.

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.All, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy |

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /serviceprincipals/{id}/owners/{id}/$ref
DELETE /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/owners/{id}/$ref
```

## Request headers
