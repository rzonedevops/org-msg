# Kiota DOM export diff tool

This tool set is used by the Microsoft Graph Developer Experience team to automate validation of source breaking changes on pre-packaged service libraries. It is not meant for public consumption or use in any other context.

## Structure

The tool set is composed of multiple GitHub actions:

- [Export](./export): creates a diff for the DOM export file.
- [Tool](./tool): analyzes the diff and provide a success/fail depending on whether source breaking changes are detected. Also provides an "explanation" of the changes.
- [Comment](./comment): adds a comment to the pull request, and removes any previously added comment if any.

## Example workflow
