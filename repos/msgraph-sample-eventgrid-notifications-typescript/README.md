# Microsoft Graph Event Grid change notifications sample for Node.js

[![npm build](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sample-eventgrid-notifications-typescript/actions/workflows/node.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sample-eventgrid-notifications-typescript/actions/workflows/node.yml) ![License.](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

Subscribe for [Microsoft Graph change notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/webhooks) to be notified when your user's data changes, so you don't have to poll for changes.

This sample Node.js web application shows how to subscribe for change notifications to be [delivered to Azure Event Grid](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/subscribe-to-graph-api-events).

This sample uses:

- The [Microsoft Graph JavaScript Client Library](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) to call Microsoft Graph.
- The [Azure Identity client library for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/identity/identity/README.md) library to handle authentication for Microsoft Graph.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 20.x](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
- The [.NET dev tunnel CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started).
- A Microsoft work or school account with the Global administrator role. If you don't have one, you can get a developer sandbox by joining the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can [start a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Create Azure resources

In order to configure the sample, you'll need to do the following steps in the Azure portal.

- [Register an application](#register-an-application) for authenticating to Microsoft Graph.
- [Create a resource group](#create-a-resource-group) where Microsoft Graph can create [partner topics for Event Grid](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/subscribe-to-partner-events).
- [Authorize Microsoft Graph to create partner topics](#authorize-microsoft-graph-to-create-partner-topics) in the resource group.

### Register an application

### Create a resource group

1. Open a browser and navigate to the [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) and login using a Global administrator account.

1. Select **Resource groups** in the left-hand navigation, then select **Create**.

1. Select the Azure subscription and region to create the resource group in, and provide a name for the resource group, then select **Review + create**.

1. Once the validation completes, select **Create**.

### Authorize Microsoft Graph to create partner topics

1. Select **Review + create**. Once the validation completes, select **Create**.

## Configure the sample

Create a new file named **.env.development.local** in the root of this project and add the following.

```ini
# The Application (client) ID from your app registration
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
# The client secret from your app registration
CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
# The Directory (tenant) ID from your app registration
TENANT_ID=YOUR_TENANT_ID
# The ID of the Azure subscription where the Event Grid partner topic should be created
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
# The name of the Azure resource group where the Event Grid partner topic should be created
RESOURCE_GROUP=YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP
# The name of the Event Grid partner topic to be created
EVENT_GRID_TOPIC=YOUR_EVENT_GRID_TOPIC
# The Azure location name (ex. eastus)
LOCATION=YOUR_AZURE_LOCATION
# The port number to listen on
PORT_NUMBER=3000
```

Set the values as follows.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| `CLIENT_ID` | The **Application (client) ID** from your app registration. |
| `CLIENT_SECRET` | The client secret from your app registration. |
| `TENANT_ID` | The **Directory (tenant) ID** from your app registration. |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | The ID of your Azure subscription. This can be found in the Azure portal. Search for **Subscriptions** and select it from the results. |
| `RESOURCE_GROUP` | The name of the resource group you created in the previous steps. |
| `EVENT_GRID_TOPIC` | The name Microsoft Graph should use to create the partner topic, for example: `EventGridNotifications`. |
| `LOCATION` | The location you created your resource group in. You can find this by running the following command in Cloud Shell in the Azure portal: `az account list-locations`. Use the `name` value for the location, for example: `eastus`. |

## Create a dev tunnel

A dev tunnel will allow Azure Event Grid to reach the sample running on your development machine.

1. Run the following command to login to the dev tunnel service. You can login with either a Microsoft Azure Active Directory account, a Microsoft account, or a GitHub account.

    ```bash
    devtunnel user login
    ```

1. Run the following commands to create a tunnel. Copy the **Tunnel ID** from the output.

    ```bash
    devtunnel create --allow-anonymous
    ```

1. Run the following command to assign the sample's port (3000) to the tunnel. Replace `tunnel-id` with the **Tunnel ID** copied in the previous step.

    ```bash
    devtunnel port create tunnel-id -p 3000
    ```

1. Run the following command to host the tunnel. Replace `tunnel-id` with the **Tunnel ID** copied in the previous step.

    ```bash
    devtunnel host tunnel-id
    ```

1. Copy the URL labeled **Connect via browser**. Open this URL in your browser and select **Continue** to enable the tunnel.

## Run the sample

1. Run the sample by pressing **F5** in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. Alternatively, you can use the `dotnet run` command.

1. Monitor the output. When you see the following, proceed to the next step.

    ```bash
    Created new subscription with ID aac7509d-94a0-4d50-addd-8341e02da4ac
    Please activate the GraphUserNotifications partner topic in the Azure portal and create an event subscription.
    ```

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the resource group you created. It should contain a new Event Grid Partner Topic. Select this topic.

    ![A screenshot of the partner topic](images/event-grid-partner-topic.png)

1. Select **Activate**.

1. Select **Event Subscription** to add a new subscription.

1. Provide a name for the subscription, then set **Endpoint Type** to **Webhook**.

1. Select **Configure an endpoint**. Enter your dev tunnel URL. Select **Confirm Selection**.

1. Select **Create** and wait for the deployment to succeed.

## Generate events

Using the Azure portal or the [Microsoft admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), add, update, or delete users. Watch the sample's output for the notifications.

```bash
Received Microsoft.Graph.UserUpdated notification from Event Grid
User Adele Vance (ID: 37a7dc1b-812b-4336-8210-76b2180b574a) was created or updated
```
