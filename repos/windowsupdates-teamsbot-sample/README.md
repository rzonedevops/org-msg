# Windows Update for Business Teams Chat Bot

Bot Framework v4 bot using Teams authentication

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to authenticate and make requests to the Microsoft Graph, specifically for Windows Updates calls.

This sample also illustrates how to use the Bot Framework support for OAuth in your bot. Teams behaves slightly differently than other channels in this regard. Specifically an Invoke Activity is sent to the bot rather than the Event Activity used by other channels. _This Invoke Activity must be forwarded to the dialog if the OAuthPrompt is being used._ This is done by subclassing the ActivityHandler and this sample includes a reusable TeamsActivityHandler. This class is a candidate for future inclusion in the Bot Framework SDK.

The sample uses the bot authentication capabilities in [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.botframework.com), providing features to make it easier to develop a bot that authenticates users to various identity providers such as Azure AD (Azure Active Directory), GitHub, Uber, etc. The OAuth token is then used to make basic Microsoft Graph queries.

> IMPORTANT: The manifest file in this app adds "token.botframework.com" to the list of `validDomains`. This must be included in any bot that uses the Bot Framework OAuth flow.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 10.14 or higher

    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```

## To try this sample

- Clone the repository


- In a console, navigate to the repository root directory


- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

- Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

- Create [Azure Bot registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/abs-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp) in Azure
    - Use the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok. Append with the path `/api/messages` used by this sample
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - Ensure that you've connected an [identity provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/authentication/add-authentication?tabs=dotnet%2Cdotnet-sample#create-the-identity-provider) to enable authentication.
- Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the Azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `teamsAppManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `teamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

- Run the bot
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## Interacting with the bot in Teams

> Note this `manifest.json` specified that the bot will be installed in a "personal" scope only. Please refer to Teams documentation for more details.

You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. The bot will respond by requesting you to login to AAD. From there you can select a workflow and provide the required additional information when prompted. Then the bot will make a call to the Graph API and execute the selected workflow.

## Deploy the bot to Azure
